The application is about the qr code scanning for our restaurant project. for this software to develop we need a team of 3 developers. the developers are raju, hari and grung. 

THe Final code is saved in MAIN brach 

for hari who is dev tem lead, he will be working on function qr scanning, for him the branch will be MAIN-qr-hari
for Raju who is A FRONT-END dev, he will be working on UI for qr scanning app page, for him the branch will be MAIN-UI-RAJU 
for Gurung who is front DB team lead , he will be working on THE Backend db connection code page for qr scanning app page, for him the branch will be MAIN-DB-GURUNG  

The strategy, to create separate branches for all these 3 developers is to work on their respective code on their machine locally and push it to remote repositories and after final merge to main to deploy the artifacts in collaborative manner and to maintain the version of their respective code.
